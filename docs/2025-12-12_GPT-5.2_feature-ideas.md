# 2025-12-12 (GPT-5.2) — Feature Ideas to Improve the Autonomous Agents Platform

## Build output & “show me what you built”
- **Preview sessions (sandbox URL)**: “Open Preview” / “Stop Preview” / TTL-based auto-expire.
- **Artifact browser**: inspect files in the artifact zip from the UI (tree view + file viewer) without downloading.
- **One-click deploy**: deploy finished build artifacts to Vercel/Netlify/Cloudflare Pages (with user OAuth).
- **Framework-aware “run instructions”**: auto-generate README/run steps based on detected framework and dependencies.

## Build management & iteration
- **Re-run build from same spec** (new build record, linked lineage).
- **Clone build with edits** (fork a build/spec).
- **Spec versioning**: show diffs between spec revisions; tie builds to spec snapshots.
- **Cancelable builds**: a “Stop build” button that calls server-side `stopBuild()` and updates status reliably.
- **Build timeline**: phases (init → implement → finalize → artifacts → done) from structured events.

## Better debugging & observability
- **Structured event UI**: first-class activity feed (tool runs, file edits, errors, progress) vs raw logs only.
- **Searchable logs**: filter by level/tool, search within build logs/events.
- **Retention policies**: configurable retention for logs/artifacts/previews (per plan tier).
- **Export diagnostics bundle**: one-click export of logs + events + spec + metadata.

## Security & trust
- **Command allowlist visualization**: show what commands/tools are allowed per harness and why.
- **Policy presets**: “Strict”, “Balanced”, “Permissive” harness policies.
- **Secrets handling**: per-build ephemeral secrets with automatic redaction in logs/events.

## Product UX & onboarding
- **Template gallery**: curated “starter specs” and “project types” to reduce blank-page friction.
- **Complexity tier explanation UI**: clarify what “simple/standard/production” changes (feature count, time, cost).
- **Cost/time estimates**: surface approximate cost/time before starting a build.
- **Notifications**: email/webhook/Slack when build completes or fails.

## Multi-tenant SaaS readiness
- **Teams + projects**: invite teammates, shared projects, role-based access.
- **Usage & billing**: track sandbox time, tokens, storage; enforce quotas per tier.
- **Audit log**: user actions (build started/stopped, spec changed, artifact downloaded).

## Platform extensibility
- **Multiple harnesses in UI**: let users choose harness profiles (coding/research/data tasks).
- **Provider selection**: E2B vs Daytona vs future providers; show capabilities per provider (preview support, persistence).
- **Pluggable “output types”**: zip download, preview, deploy, static export, etc.

## Low-effort improvements (quick wins)
- **Update `apps/web/README.md`** to describe the actual platform (commands, env, local infra).
- **Fix env defaults mismatch** (docker-compose Postgres creds vs `env.example`).
- **Improve “real sandbox mode” detection** (don’t treat placeholder keys as real).
