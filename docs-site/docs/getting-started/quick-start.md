# Quick Start

This guide will walk you through creating your first autonomous build.

## 1. Sign In

Navigate to the web application and sign in with your account. New users can sign up through Clerk authentication.

## 2. Create a New Build

### Option A: Chat Interface

Use the chat interface to describe what you want to build. The AI will guide you through refining your requirements and generate an app specification.

```
You: I want to build a todo app with user authentication
AI: Great! Let me help you define the requirements...
```

### Option B: Wizard Interface

Use the step-by-step wizard to configure your build:

1. **Project Setup** - Name and description
2. **Stack Selection** - Choose your tech stack
3. **Features** - Define the features you need
4. **Review** - Confirm the generated app spec

## 3. Launch the Build

Once your app specification is ready, click "Start Build" to launch the autonomous agent. The agent will:

1. Create a secure cloud sandbox
2. Set up the project structure
3. Implement features one by one
4. Run tests and validate the build

## 4. Monitor Progress

Watch the build progress in real-time:

- **Activity Feed** - See what the agent is doing
- **Feature Checklist** - Track completed features
- **File Viewer** - Browse generated code
- **Preview Panel** - See the running application

## 5. Download Your Project

Once the build completes, download the generated project as a ZIP file or deploy it directly.
