# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code.

## How to Add a Changeset

When you make a change to a package, run:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

Follow the prompts to:
1. Select which packages have changed
2. Choose the semver bump type (major/minor/patch)
3. Write a summary of the changes

This creates a new markdown file in this folder describing the change.

## How Changes Get Published

1. When you push changes with changeset files, a GitHub Action will:
   - Create a "Version Packages" PR
   - Update CHANGELOG.md files
   - Bump version numbers

2. Merging that PR publishes the changes.

## Writing Good Changeset Summaries

- **Be concise but descriptive**: "Add password protection to documentation site"
- **Focus on the user impact**: "Users can now filter builds by status"
- **For bug fixes, mention what was broken**: "Fix sandbox timeout during long builds"
